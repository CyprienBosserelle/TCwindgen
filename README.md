# TCwindgen
Quickly generate wind and pressure field from hurricane/Tropical cyclones based on track parameter.
This code was specifically created to generate forcing for hydrodynamics model that simulate waves and storm surges.
The code includes C CUDA implementation of wind model already implemented in the tcrm code but were converted from Py to CUDA C.
input files can be generated for :
Delft3D
SWAN

Many more will be implemented
